 Korean dramas are known for bringing on the feels every single time. Some are fleeting and are remembered only for a season; but others are life-changing and get quoted to  by anyone and everyone whether they’re a K-drama fan or not. My love for korean dramas , led me to do an analysis of the dramas I have watched , and also to put my analysing and visualising skills to work. This repository consisist of analysis of 191 dramas which I have watched over 3 years , like analysis on the a particular Actor, Director , Writer then recommendations based on Genre , Year , Numbe of Episodes etc.
